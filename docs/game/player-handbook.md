## 2. 🚀 Getting Started

### Creating Your Account

Launch the app and you'll be guided through a quick registration process. Once you're in, it's time to forge your hero.

### Choosing Your Class

This is the most important decision you'll make at the start of your journey. LoreEngine offers **four distinct classes**, each with unique strengths, starting equipment, and playstyles.

#### ⚔️ Warrior

*"Steel solves most problems."*

The Warrior is the frontline fighter — tough, powerful, and built to take a hit. If you like charging headfirst into danger, this is your class.

- **Stat Bonus:** STR 14, DEX 10
- **Starting Equipment:**
  - ⚔️ Iron Sword (weapon, common)
  - 🛡️ Leather Shield (armor, common)
  - 🧪 Healing Potion ×2 (potion)
- **Playstyle:** Direct combat, tanking damage, brute-force solutions

#### 🪄 Mage

*"Knowledge is the ultimate weapon."*

The Mage wields arcane power and ancient knowledge. Physically fragile but devastatingly powerful, the Mage bends reality to their will.

- **Stat Bonus:** WIS 14, CHA 12
- **Starting Equipment:**
  - 🪄 Oak Staff (weapon, uncommon)
  - 📕 Spellbook (misc, rare)
  - 🧪 Healing Potion ×2 (potion)
- **Playstyle:** Magic-based combat, puzzle solving, lore discovery

#### 🗡️ Rogue

*"Why fight fair when you can fight smart?"*

The Rogue is a master of stealth, cunning, and precision. If you prefer outsmarting your enemies rather than overpowering them, the Rogue is calling your name.

- **Stat Bonus:** DEX 14, CHA 12
- **Starting Equipment:**
  - 🗡️ Twin Daggers (weapon, uncommon)
  - 🔧 Lockpicks (key, uncommon)
  - 🧪 Healing Potion ×2 (potion)
- **Playstyle:** Stealth, traps, critical strikes, lockpicking

#### 🧭 Explorer

*"The journey is the destination."*

The Explorer is the jack-of-all-trades — equally comfortable in combat, conversation, and cartography. Balanced stats make the Explorer the most versatile class, perfect for players who want to experience everything.

- **Stat Bonus:** Balanced (all stats start at 10)
- **Starting Equipment:**
  - 🏒 Walking Stick (weapon, common)
  - 🗺️ Traveler's Map (misc, common)
  - 🧪 Healing Potion ×2 (potion)
- **Playstyle:** Exploration, adaptability, well-rounded approach

### Your First Steps

After creating your character, you'll find yourself at **The Crossroads** — the central hub of the world. From here, four paths branch out into the unknown. Talk to NPCs, check your inventory, and when you're ready... pick a direction and start your adventure.

---

## 3. 🧬 Understanding Your Character

### Stats

Your character is defined by four core stats. These determine what you're good at and influence dice rolls throughout the game.

| Stat | Abbr. | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Strength** | STR | Physical power, melee combat damage, feats of might |
| **Dexterity** | DEX | Agility, ranged attacks, dodging, stealth |
| **Wisdom** | WIS | Magic ability, knowledge checks, perception |
| **Charisma** | CHA | Persuasion, NPC interactions, bartering prices |

- **Base Value:** Every stat starts at **10**
- Your chosen class may grant bonuses to specific stats
- Stats influence your dice roll modifiers (see [The Dice System](#4--the-dice-system))

### Stat Modifiers

Your stats provide bonuses to dice rolls using the D&D-style formula: **Modifier = (Stat − 10) ÷ 2** (rounded toward zero).

| Stat Value | Modifier | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | −1 | Explorer's default |
| 10 | +0 | Baseline (default for all classes) |
| 12 | +1 | Rogue's CHA, Mage's CHA |
| 14 | +2 | Warrior's STR, Rogue's DEX, Mage's WIS |
| 16 | +3 | Rare enchanted stats |
| 18 | +4 | Legendary |
| 20 | +5 | Mythical |

These modifiers are added on top of your D20 roll when attempting actions related to that stat.

### Hit Points (HP)

Your HP represents your character's vitality — how much punishment you can take before going down.

- **Starting HP:** 100
- **Damage** reduces your HP
- **Healing** (potions, rest, magic) restores HP
- **At 0 HP:** Your character is **incapacitated** — the adventure isn't over, but you're in serious trouble
- ⚠️ **Critical Warning:** When your HP drops below **25%**, you'll see a visual pulse animation on your health bar — a clear signal to heal up or retreat!

### Inventory

Your inventory holds everything you've collected on your journey — weapons, armor, potions, keys, and miscellaneous items. Each item has:

- A **type** (weapon, armor, potion, key, misc)
- A **rarity** tier (see [Items & Equipment](#7--items--equipment))
- An **emoji icon** for quick identification
- A **description** with lore and gameplay info

---

## 4. 🎲 The Dice System

At the heart of LoreEngine lies the **D20 system** — a time-honored mechanic that adds tension, excitement, and unpredictability to every action you take.

### How Rolls Work

When you attempt something challenging — attacking a creature, picking a lock, persuading a guard — the game rolls a **20-sided die (D20)** behind the scenes.

```
🎲 Your Roll = D20 + Stat Modifier
       vs.
🎯 Difficulty Class (DC)
```

**If your total ≥ the DC → Success!**
**If your total < the DC → Failure.**

### Difficulty Class (DC) Scale

The DC represents how hard a task is. The scale runs from 1 to 20:

| DC | Difficulty | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1–5 | Trivial | Opening an unlocked door |
| 6–9 | Easy | Climbing a low wall |
| **10** | **Moderate** | Picking a simple lock |
| 11–14 | Challenging | Persuading a suspicious guard |
| 15–17 | Hard | Dodging a trap in the dark |
| 18–19 | Very Hard | Deciphering ancient runes |
| 20 | Nearly Impossible | Talking down a raging dragon |

### Critical Rolls

These are the moments that make legends — or cautionary tales.

#### 💥 Critical Success — Natural 20

Roll a natural 20 on the die (before modifiers) and you achieve a **Critical Success**. This **always succeeds**, no matter the DC. Critical hits in combat deal extra damage, and skill checks may yield spectacular bonus results.

*"You don't just pick the lock — you discover a hidden compartment behind it containing a rare gemstone."*

#### 💀 Critical Failure — Natural 1

Roll a natural 1 and you suffer a **Critical Failure**. This **always fails**, regardless of your modifiers. Something goes wrong — comically, dramatically, or dangerously.

*"You attempt to sneak past the guard... and step on a cat's tail. The entire barracks is now awake."*

### 🔥 Success Streaks

LoreEngine tracks your consecutive successful dice rolls. When you're on a roll (pun intended), you'll see a **streak counter** displayed as:

> 🔥x3 — *Three successes in a row!*

The game also tracks your **Max Streak** — your personal best. Can you beat it? Success streaks are pure bragging rights, but there's something deeply satisfying about seeing that fire emoji climb higher and higher.

## 5. 🗺️ Exploring the World

The world of LoreEngine is a web of **12 interconnected locations**, each with its own atmosphere, creatures, NPCs, and secrets. Travel between them by following the paths on the world map.

### The World Map

```
                    🏛️ Ancient Temple
                   ↗
        🌲 Dark Forest
       ↗               ↘
      /                  🏠 Witch's Hut ←┐
     /                                    |
✖️ The Crossroads ─→ 🏚️ Swamp of Sorrows ─→ 🗿 Sunken Ruins
     \
      \
       ↘
        🏘️ Village of Thornwall ─→ 🏰 Castle Ironhold
                    ↘
                     🏪 Market Square
      ↘
       ⛰️ Mountain Path ─→ 🐉 Dragon's Peak
                    ↘
                     ⛏️ Dwarven Mines
```

### Location Guide

| Icon | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ✖️ | **The Crossroads** | Your starting point and the central hub. Four paths diverge from here. Safe, but don't linger too long — adventure awaits. |
| 🌲 | **Dark Forest** | Towering trees block out the sun. Strange sounds echo between the trunks. Home to goblins and worse. |
| 🏛️ | **Ancient Temple** | Crumbling stone pillars and faded murals hint at a forgotten civilization. What treasures — or traps — lie within? |
| 🏠 | **Witch's Hut** | A crooked cottage in a clearing. The witch may be friend or foe — it depends on what you bring her. Reachable from both the Dark Forest and the Swamp of Sorrows. |
| 🏘️ | **Village of Thornwall** | A small but lively village with friendly folk, a tavern, and rumors aplenty. A good place to resupply. |
| 🏰 | **Castle Ironhold** | A fortress of dark stone perched on a cliff. Its lord is said to guard a powerful secret. |
| 🏪 | **Market Square** | Bustling with merchants and traders. The best place to buy, sell, and barter for equipment. |
| ⛰️ | **Mountain Path** | A winding, treacherous trail climbing into the peaks. The air grows thin and the creatures grow fierce. |
| 🐉 | **Dragon's Peak** | The summit. Scorched earth and massive claw marks tell you everything you need to know. Only the brave — or foolish — venture here. |
| ⛏️ | **Dwarven Mines** | Deep tunnels rich with ore and crystal. The dwarves who once worked here are long gone. What drove them out? |
| 🏚️ | **Swamp of Sorrows** | Murky waters, thick fog, and an overwhelming sense of dread. Something lurks beneath the surface. |
| 🗿 | **Sunken Ruins** | Half-submerged stone structures from an age before memory. The swamp has claimed them, but their power remains. |

### Travel Tips

- **Talk to NPCs** at each location — they offer quests, lore, and items
- **Explore thoroughly** — hidden passages and secret areas exist for those who look carefully
- **Watch your HP** before entering dangerous zones like Dragon's Peak or the Swamp
- **The Witch's Hut** is reachable from two different paths — it's a useful shortcut between the forest and the swamp

---

## 6. ⚔️ Combat

When words fail and diplomacy breaks down, it's time to fight. Combat in LoreEngine uses the same D20 dice system as everything else, but with some additional mechanics.

### How Combat Works

1. **Encounter** — You meet a hostile creature (or provoke a neutral one)
2. **Action Phase** — Choose your action: attack, defend, use an item, flee, or try something creative
3. **Dice Roll** — The game rolls D20 + your relevant stat modifier
4. **Resolution** — Your roll is compared against the creature's Attack DC:
   - **Your attack:** Roll ≥ creature's DC → You deal damage
   - **Creature's attack:** The creature rolls against your defenses
5. **Repeat** until one side is defeated, flees, or finds another resolution

### Combat Tips

- **Know your enemy** — Check the [Bestiary](#11--creatures-of-the-realm) for creature weaknesses
- **Use items** — A well-timed Health Potion can turn the tide
- **Play to your class** — Warriors should lean on STR, Rogues on DEX, Mages on WIS
- **Exploit weaknesses** — A fire-based attack against a Forest Troll is far more effective than a regular strike
- **Retreat is valid** — There's no shame in running from a fight you can't win. Live to fight another day.
- **Creative solutions** — The Bandit Captain can be *bribed*. Not every fight needs to end in blood.

### Defeat

If your HP reaches **0**, your character is **incapacitated**. This isn't permanent death — LoreEngine is about story, and even defeat becomes part of your tale. But it will have consequences.

---

## 7. 🎒 Items & Equipment

Your inventory is your lifeline. From the sword in your hand to the potion in your pack, items can mean the difference between victory and a long walk back from defeat.

### Item Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| ⚔️ **Weapon** | Swords, staves, daggers — your primary tools of combat |
| 🛡️ **Armor** | Shields, helmets, cloaks — reduce incoming damage |
| 🧪 **Potion** | Consumable items that heal, buff, or cause effects |
| 🔑 **Key** | Unlock doors, chests, and secret passages |
| 📦 **Misc** | Everything else — quest items, tools, trinkets, and curiosities |

### Rarity Tiers

Items come in five rarity tiers. Rarer items are more powerful and harder to find.

| Rarity | Color | Visual | How Common? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Common** | Gray | — | Found everywhere. Basic but reliable. |
| **Uncommon** | 🟢 Green | — | A step above ordinary. Slightly better stats or unique effects. |
| **Rare** | 🔵 Blue | — | Genuinely powerful. Worth holding onto. |
| **Epic** | 🟣 Purple | — | Exceptional gear with unique abilities. Hard to find. |
| **Legendary** | 🟠 Orange | ✨ Glowing | The stuff of myths. Game-changing power. Extremely rare. |

### Managing Your Inventory

- **Equip weapons and armor** to gain their benefits in combat
- **Use potions** during or outside of combat — but choose wisely, they're consumed on use
- **Key items** are used automatically when you encounter the matching lock or barrier
- **Sell unwanted items** at the Market Square for gold
- **Check item descriptions** — they often contain lore hints and gameplay tips

---

## 8. 💰 Gold & Economy

Gold makes the world go round — even a fantasy one.

### Earning Gold

| Source | How |
|---|---|
| 🗡️ **Combat** | Defeating creatures drops gold (varies by creature) |
| 📜 **Quests** | Completing quests rewards gold |
| 💎 **Treasure** | Discovering hidden caches and chests |
| 🏪 **Selling** | Sell unwanted items to merchants |

### Spending Gold

| Use | Where |
|---|---|
| 🛒 **Buy Equipment** | Purchase weapons, armor, and potions from merchants |
| 💬 **Bribe NPCs** | Some characters respond better to coin than charm |
| 🔓 **Access** | Certain areas or services require payment |

### Starting Gold

Every adventurer begins with **10 gold** — enough for a meal and maybe a cheap potion. You'll need to earn more through combat, exploration, and clever trading.

### Economic Tips

- **Don't hoard common items** — sell them for gold to buy better gear
- **Charisma affects bartering** — a high CHA stat can get you better prices
- **Some creatures are goldmines** — literally. The Ancient Dragon drops 500 gold. If you can survive.

### The Bestiary

---

#### 👺 Goblin Scout — *Level 1*

*"Small, green, and mean. They hunt in packs, so where there's one..."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | 8 | 3 | 25 | 5 | 🔥 Fire |

**Tips:** A great first enemy. Low DC makes them easy to hit. Watch out for ambushes.

---

#### 🐀 Dire Rat — *Level 1*

*"Bigger than a house cat and twice as vicious. The sewers are full of them."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 6 | 2 | 15 | 2 | 💡 Light |

**Tips:** The weakest creature in the game. Perfect for warming up. Vulnerable to light-based attacks.

---

#### 💀 Skeleton Warrior — *Level 2*

*"The dead don't rest easy in this world. They pick up swords instead."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | 10 | 5 | 40 | 10 | 🔨 Bludgeoning |

**Tips:** Moderate challenge. Blunt weapons work best — smash the bones, don't try to cut them.

---

#### 👻 Shadow Wisp — *Level 3*

*"A flickering light in the darkness. Beautiful — and deadly."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 12 | 7 | 60 | 15 | ☀️ Radiant / Holy |

**Tips:** Low HP but hard to hit. Holy or radiant attacks are highly effective. Mages have an advantage here.

---

#### 🗡️ Bandit Captain — *Level 3*

*"'Your money or your life' — and he means it."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35 | 13 | 8 | 75 | 50 | 💰 Can be bribed |

**Tips:** Tough fighter with a big gold drop. But here's a secret — **he can be bribed**. High CHA characters can skip this fight entirely (and save gold in the long run).

---

#### 🧌 Forest Troll — *Level 4*

*"Eight feet tall and hungry. It regenerates — unless you burn it."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 60 | 11 | 10 | 100 | 25 | 🔥 Fire |

**Tips:** High HP and strong damage, but a relatively low ATK DC. Fire is essential — without it, the troll regenerates. Bring a torch or fire magic.

---

#### 💎 Crystal Golem — *Level 5*

*"Carved from living crystal, it moves with surprising speed for something that weighs a ton."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 80 | 14 | 12 | 150 | 40 | ⚡ Thunder |

**Tips:** A serious threat. High HP, high DC, and solid damage. Thunder-based attacks shatter its crystal structure. Without them, prepare for a long fight.

---

#### 🦇 Wraith Lord — *Level 6*

*"It was a king once. Now it rules only shadows."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | 15 | 15 | 200 | 100 | ☀️ Sunlight |

**Tips:** Low HP for its level but extremely dangerous — high DC and massive damage. Fight it in daylight if possible. The 100 gold drop makes it a lucrative target.

---

#### 🐍 Swamp Hydra — *Level 7*

*"Cut off one head and two more take its place. Unless you cauterize the stumps."*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 13 | 18 | 250 | 60 | 🔥 Fire |

**Tips:** Massive HP pool and devastating damage. Fire is the key — it prevents the hydra from regenerating its heads. Stock up on fire-based items before entering the Swamp.

---

#### 🐉 Ancient Dragon — *Level 10*

*"The apex predator. It has lived for a thousand years and has killed everything that challenged it. Are you sure about this?"*

| HP | ATK DC | DMG | XP | Gold | Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 200 | 18 | 30 | 1000 | 500 | — |

**Tips:** The ultimate boss. 200 HP, near-impossible DC of 18, and 30 damage per hit. There is no listed weakness — you'll need max-level gear, full HP, plenty of potions, and a lot of luck. Defeating it earns the **Dragon Slayer** achievement and a massive 1,000 XP. This is the fight that defines legends.

---

## 12. 🌀 Twists of Fate

The world of LoreEngine is unpredictable. At any moment, a **Twist of Fate** may occur — a random event that shakes up your adventure. There are **16 possible twists** across four categories.

### 🌍 Environment Twists

| Twist | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **🌋 Earthquake** | The ground shakes violently. Paths may change, structures may collapse, and new areas may be revealed. |
| **🌑 Eclipse** | Darkness falls. Creatures of shadow grow stronger, and visibility drops to near zero. |
| **🌫️ Fog of Whispers** | A thick fog rolls in carrying ghostly voices. Follow them at your own risk — they may lead to treasure or to doom. |
| **✨ Wild Magic Surge** | Raw magical energy erupts. Spells go haywire, items may gain temporary enchantments, and reality bends. |

### ⚔️ Combat Twists

| Twist | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **🏹 Ambush** | Enemies attack without warning! You start the encounter on the back foot. Stay alert in dangerous territory. |

### 👤 Encounter Twists

| Twist | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **🎭 Mysterious Stranger** | A cloaked figure appears with an offer. Their motives are unclear — will you trust them? |
| **🏪 Merchant of Wonders** | A travelling merchant appears with rare and exotic wares. Stock up while you can — they won't be here long. |
| **🐾 Wounded Creature** | You find an injured creature. Help it and you may gain an ally. Ignore it and... well, karma is real in LoreEngine. |

### 🔍 Discovery Twists

| Twist | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **🚪 Hidden Passage** | You discover a secret path to a hidden area. What lies beyond? |
| **🏺 Ancient Artifact** | You find a relic of immense power from a forgotten age. It may be a blessing — or a curse. |

|---|---|
| **💭 Memory Flash** | A sudden vision reveals a piece of your character's forgotten past. It may unlock new dialogue options or quest paths. |
| **☠️ Cursed!** | A dark enchantment latches onto you. Suffer a temporary debuff until you find a way to break it. |
| **⚔️ Rival Appears** | A rival adventurer challenges you. They want what you have — your reputation, your treasure, or your life. |
| **👼 Divine Vision** | A celestial being speaks to you in a vision, offering guidance, a blessing, or a divine quest. |

## 13. 🔮 The Oracle

*"Seek the Oracle when the path grows dark, but heed this warning — truth rarely comes in plain words."*

### What Is the Oracle?

The Oracle is an AI-powered NPC that exists to help you when you're stuck. It speaks in **riddles, prophecy, and archaic language** — you won't get a straightforward answer, but a clever adventurer can decode its hints.

### How to Use the Oracle

When you're lost, confused, or unsure of your next step, seek out the Oracle. It will provide a **cryptic hint** related to your current situation.

**Example Oracle Responses:**

> *"The serpent fears the flame, child. What burns, cleanses. What cleanses, conquers."*
> (Translation: Use fire against the Swamp Hydra)

> *"Three keys lie scattered where mortals dare not tread. The temple remembers. The mines echo. The ruins whisper."*
> (Translation: Find keys in the Ancient Temple, Dwarven Mines, and Sunken Ruins)

### Oracle Tips

- The Oracle's hints are **always relevant** to your current quest or situation
- Read the hints carefully — key words are your clues
- The Oracle won't solve the puzzle for you, but it will point you in the right direction
- Visiting the Oracle is free — use it as often as you like

## 14. ✍️ The Writers' Room

*"Why play someone else's story when you can write your own?"*

### What Is the Writers' Room?

The Writers' Room is LoreEngine's unique **collaborative storytelling mode**. Instead of playing through AI-generated content, you work alongside **three AI agents** to craft your own adventure before playing it.

### The Three Agents

| Agent | Role | What They Do |
|---|---|---|
| 📝 **Storyteller** | The Creative | Generates plot ideas, dialogue, and narrative beats. The Storyteller is your co-author, spinning tales based on your prompts and ideas. |
| 🔍 **Critic** | The Editor | Reviews the story for consistency, pacing, and quality. The Critic catches plot holes, balances encounters, and ensures your story makes sense. |
| 📚 **Archivist** | The Keeper | Tracks lore, continuity, and world-building details. The Archivist remembers everything and ensures your story stays internally consistent. |

### How It Works

1. **Pitch an Idea** — Tell the Storyteller your concept: "A heist in Castle Ironhold" or "A mystery in the Sunken Ruins"
2. **Collaborate** — The Storyteller drafts scenes, the Critic provides feedback, and the Archivist tracks details
3. **Refine** — Iterate on the story until it's exactly what you want
4. **Play** — Jump into your custom adventure and experience it as a player

## 15. 💡 Tips & Strategies

### For New Players

1. **Start as an Explorer** if you're unsure — balanced stats mean you can handle anything
2. **Visit the Village of Thornwall early** — stock up on supplies before heading into danger
3. **Save your potions** for tough fights — don't waste them on Dire Rats
4. **Talk to everyone** — NPCs offer quests, hints, and sometimes free items
5. **Use the Oracle** when stuck — it's free and always helpful (once you decode the riddles)

### For Combat

1. **Exploit weaknesses** — fire against Trolls and Hydras, bludgeoning against Skeletons
2. **Know when to run** — if your HP is low and you're facing a Level 5+ creature, retreat
3. **The Bandit Captain can be bribed** — sometimes gold is cheaper than HP
4. **Stock up before Dragon's Peak** — full HP, plenty of potions, best gear you have
5. **Build success streaks** — consecutive successes build momentum (and look cool)

### For Exploration

1. **Map the connections** — knowing which locations connect to which is crucial for efficient travel
2. **The Witch's Hut is a shortcut** — it connects the Dark Forest and Swamp of Sorrows paths
3. **Don't skip locations** — every area has unique content, lore, and rewards
4. **Watch for Twists of Fate** — random events can open up new areas (Hidden Passage) or grant rare items (Ancient Artifact)

### For Economy

1. **Sell common items** you don't need — hoard gold, not gray-tier junk
2. **The Wraith Lord drops 100 gold** — high risk, high reward
3. **Invest in good gear** at the Market Square before tackling end-game content
4. **High Charisma saves money** — better barter prices add up over time
